# Re-Align Workshop Hackathon

This hackathon focuses on understanding and comparing representational alignment across a wide variety of vision models. Participants will join either the Blue Team or the Red Team and provide JSON submissions that demonstrate the largest uniform set of models (Blue) or greatest differentiation among those models (Red).

Hackathon Overview
We have ~1300 vision models available for use, plus metadata about each model‚Äôs architecture, training data, and more. The hackathon aims to answer:

When are models ‚Äúfunctionally identical‚Äù (indistinguishable) in their behaviors?
When do models show meaningful differences‚Äîand how can we highlight those differences with carefully chosen stimuli?
Key points:

## Team Objectives

### üü¶ Blue Team:
Identify universal patterns across models by finding sets that function identically on selected stimuli.

- **Objective**: Submit a collection of models that demonstrate functional equivalence when processing the same stimulus set.
- **Challenge**: Find surprising similarities among seemingly different architectures.

### üü• Red Team:
Uncover meaningful functional differences between models by carefully selecting diagnostic stimuli.

- **Objective**: Curate stimuli that reveal significant functional differences between model groups.
- **Challenge**: Identify the most informative test cases that highlight meaningful variation.

## Submission Requirements
Your final submission must be in JSON format for the Blue Team and a zip file for the Red team. The submission should document:
1. Your methodology for identifying similar models (Blue) or selecting revealing stimuli (Red)
2. A concise rationale explaining your findings
3. Supporting evidence for your conclusions

For more detailed instructions, look below

We look forward to discovering insights about representational alignment - whether through unexpected uniformity or revealing differences between models.


## Submission Instructions

- **File Type**: JSON
- **File Name**: `team_name.json` (replace "team_name" with your actual team name)
- **File Location**: Place your submission in the `{blue/red}_team_submissions/` directory

### Blue Team JSON format

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "model_name": "model1_name",
      "source": "where the model is from",
      "model_parameters": {
        "param1": "value1",
        "param2": "value2"
      }
    },
    {
      "model_name": "model2_name",
      "source": "where the model is from",
      "model_parameters": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### Red Team JSON format

```json
{
  "differentiating_images": [
    {
      "dataset_name": "cifar100",
      "image_identifier": "test/girl/image_987.png"
    },
    {
      "dataset_name": "cifar100",
      "image_identifier": "test/orange/image_19.png"
    },
    {
      "dataset_name": "cifar100",
      "image_identifier": "test/bottle/image_2428.png"
    }
    // ‚Ä¶ add as many entries as needed
  ]
}
```

**Field descriptions**

| Key | Purpose | Example |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `dataset_name` | Name of the public dataset the stimulus comes from. | `"cifar100"` |
| `image_identifier` | Path or unique identifier that locates the file within your submission‚Äôs `stimuli/` directory. | `"test/girl/image_987.png"` |

Notes:
- Include **exactly** these two keys for every stimulus object.  
- Place the actual image / audio / video files in the `stimuli/` folder of your ZIP submission‚Äîdo **not** embed binary data in the JSON.  
- Ensure every `(dataset_name, image_identifier)` pair is **unique**.

### Setup & Submission (Applies to **Both Blue and Red Teams**)

#### 1&nbsp;‚Äî&nbsp;Fork and Clone
1. **Fork** this repository on GitHub:

2. **Clone** your fork and create a branch for your submission (replace `<team_color>` with either `blue` or `red`):
   ```bash
   git clone [PATH_TO_YOUR_FORK]
   cd realign-metrics
   git checkout -b <team_color>_team_winning_submission
   ```

#### 2 ‚Äî Prepare Your Submission
| Team | Place the file(s) in | Required main file | Commit message title example |
|------|----------------------|--------------------|------------------------------|
| **Blue** | `blue_team_submissions/` | `team_name.json` | `Blue Team Submission: [team_name]` |
| **Red** | `red_team_submissions/` | `team_name.json` | `Red Team Submission: [team_name]` |

*Create your file(s) according to the validation rules in the earlier ‚ÄúBlue Team JSON format‚Äù and ‚ÄúRed Team ZIP format‚Äù sections.*
